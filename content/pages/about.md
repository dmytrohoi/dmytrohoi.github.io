My first programming language it's a Delphi. In a school I learn Delphi and Pascal, build on it base a first scripts and programs. In a 10 - 11 classes I was programming at this languages.

After the school, in University I was learn a C++ and C, but don't like it. Also was used Pascal and Assembler in education process.

On last University course I was start programming on Python and create my first projects. After that and to today I was writing on Javascript, Bash, Jekyll and Jinja.

Simple table my experience in programming:
